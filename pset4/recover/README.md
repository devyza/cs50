# Recover

A program written in C that recovers JPEGs from a forensic image.

In digital forensic, data which has been stored in hard drive or memory  cards is not completely "deleted" in the system. Files which are supposed to be deleted will continue existing on the system until they are overwritten. However, deleted files can still be restored using recovery program.
