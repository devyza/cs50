## Usage
    $ python3 mario.py

## Examples

 > :warning: Note: Height of the pyramid should be a positive integer between 1 and 8.

Here is how the program might if the user inputs is `3`.

    $ python3 mario.py
    Height: 3
      #
     ##
    ###

If the user doesnâ€™t, in fact, input a positive integer between 1 and 8, inclusive, when prompted, the program should re-prompt the user until they cooperate:

    $ python3 mario.py
    Height: -1
    Height: 0
    Height: 42
    Height: 50
    Height: 4
       #
